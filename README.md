Risk Calculation Algorithm:
We had 3 stages for prediction and risk factor was supposed to be calculated for stage2 and stage3.
Using the predicted labels and precalculated weights, the count of labels for each stage and total weight of all labels in a particular chat was then calculated.
A certain threshold was also defined and using the threshold, risk % of stage2 and stage3 were calculated and highest risk stage was given as output.


Hate Speech classification was done using VADER sentiment analyser and one self created model.
